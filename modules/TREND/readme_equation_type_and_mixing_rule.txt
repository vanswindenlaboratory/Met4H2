Which equation type should be used?
1: Helmholtz EOS
2: Soave Redlich Kwong (SRK)
3: Peng-Robinson (PR)
4: Lee-Kesler-Plöcker (LKP)
51: Generalized equation by Alexandrov et al. 
52: Generalized equation by Span
53: Generalized equation by Sun & Ely
6: PCP-SAFT
7: AGA8 EOS
8: Revised Klosek and McKinley method (RKM)
81: Enhanced revised Klosek and McKinley method by Tietz et al. (ERKM)
9: Costald EOS (for the calculation of liquified natural gases => only valid for the saturated liquid and and subcooled liquid density)

Which mixing rules should be used?
1: Helmholtz mixture model
2: SRK mixing rule
3: PR mixing rule
4: LKP mixing rule
51,52,53: Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rule
8: RKM mixing rule
81: ERKM mixing rule
9: Costald EOS mixing rule

Since the SRK/PR/LKP is integrated to the Helmholtz Energy, it is possible to use these equations with the Helmholtz mixture model. However, it is not possible to use Helmholtz Equations with the SRK/PR/LKP mixing rules!
