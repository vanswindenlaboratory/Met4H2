? An Equation of State for the Thermodynamic Properties of Cyclohexane,
? J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, 43, 043105, 2014.
?
?The uncertainties in density for the equation of state are 0.1% (liquid and
? vapor) up to 500 K, and 0.2% above 500 K, with higher uncertainties within the
? critical region.  Between 283 and 473 K with pressures lower than 30 MPa, the
? uncertainty is as low as 0.03% in density in the liquid phase.  The
? uncertainties in the speed of sound are 0.2% between 283 K and 323 K in the
? liquid, and 1% elsewhere.  Other uncertainties are 0.05% in vapor pressure and
? 2% in heat capacities.
